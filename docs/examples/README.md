# Screeps MCP Server Usage Examples

This section provides practical examples of how to use the Screeps MCP Server's tools and resources to accomplish common tasks and workflows. These examples are designed to help users understand how to combine different functionalities for effective game management.

## Example Categories

The examples are grouped into common use-case scenarios:

1.  **[Basic Monitoring](./monitoring.md)**
    *   Examples demonstrating how to set up a basic dashboard for monitoring room status, resource levels, and player notifications.
    *   Covers tools like `getOwnedRooms`, `getRoomOverview`, `getPlayerInfo`, and resources like `/player/messages`.

2.  **[Colony Automation](./automation.md)**
    *   Examples showcasing how to automate routine tasks such as resource balancing between rooms, auto-spawning creeps based on needs, or managing construction queues.
    *   Involves tools like `readMemorySegment`, `writeMemorySegment`, `createMarketOrder`, `executeConsole`.

3.  **[Performance Analysis & Optimization](./analysis.md)**
    *   Examples illustrating how to use analysis tools to identify CPU bottlenecks, optimize energy usage, or improve creep efficiency.
    *   Utilizes tools like `getCPUStats`, `getRoomEnergyAnalysis`, `analyzePathfindingEfficiency`.

4.  **[Market Trading Strategies](./trading.md)** (To be created)
    *   Examples of implementing simple or advanced trading strategies using market tools.
    *   Focuses on tools like `getMarketOrders`, `analyzeMarketTrends`, `createMarketOrder`.

5.  **[Defense & Alerting](./defense.md)** (To be created)
    *   Examples of setting up alerts for incoming attacks or monitoring defensive structure integrity.
    *   Uses tools like `getRoomDefenseStatus`, `createGameAlert`, and resources like `/game/room/events/{roomName}`.

## Structure of Examples

Each example will typically include:

*   **Goal**: A clear description of what the example aims to achieve.
*   **Tools/Resources Used**: A list of the MCP tools and resources involved.
*   **Step-by-Step Guide**: A sequence of actions or tool calls to achieve the goal.
*   **Expected Outcome**: What the user should expect as a result.
*   **Notes/Considerations**: Any important caveats, best practices, or further ideas related to the example.

These examples will be expanded as the server's tools and resources are implemented and refined.
