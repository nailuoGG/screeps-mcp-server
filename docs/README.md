# Screeps MCP Server

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that interacts with the Screeps game API via the `node-screeps-api` library.

## Project Overview

The Screeps MCP Server aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and resources for interacting with the Screeps game. This allows users to monitor their game state, analyze performance, automate tasks, and manage their colonies more effectively through the MCP interface.

## Features

The server will implement a wide range of features, categorized as follows:

- **Basic Operations**: Accessing player information, room lists, and details.
- **Monitoring & Visualization**: Visualizing room layouts, creep movements, and resource distribution.
- **Performance Analysis**: Tracking CPU usage, resource efficiency, and overall colony metrics.
- **Market Intelligence**: Analyzing market trends, finding arbitrage opportunities, and automating trades.
- **Memory & Code Management**: Reading/writing game memory, managing code branches, and deploying updates.
- **Combat & Defense Analysis**: Assessing defense strength, analyzing combat logs, and simulating tower coverage.
- **Automation & Alerts**: Setting up alerts for game events and automating routine tasks.
- **Advanced Planning & Simulation**: Simulating colony expansion, pathfinding, and build orders.
- **Inter-shard & Alliance Operations**: Coordinating actions across multiple shards and managing diplomatic relations.

## Setup and Installation

Next, I will create the `docs/architecture.md` file.
